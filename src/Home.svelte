      <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center">
      <p style="max-width:550px">The Neuroregen Collective was founded in 2022. <br>
        We exist for those who want a high level of performance and growth in their life without wasting time.<br><br>

        At the moment, we are a relatively small organization, but we are networking and growing our reach to bring light to effective methods of self-growth.<br><br>

        We support and create projects (and also research) that helps people become the highest performing version of themselves. On top of supporting high performers, we also support privacy, free speech and open-source software.<br><br>
      
        <u>New projects soon!</u><br>
